# Situated Cognition 360 Editor 2021

This project contains source code and runnable application of an editor and a player. Each stored in a separated file.


How to Use
SC360VideoEditor file and SC360Player file are the source code of the editor and the player of our project. To need to get Unity to view the content, we use version 2019.4.14f1 in our project (https://unity.cn/releases/lts/2019). Then you can open the folder with Unity directly. Open the sample Scene in assets/scene and click the play button to view real time execution.

To run the build version, simply double click the SC360.exe in EditorBuild to open the editor and click 360Player.exe in PlayerBuild to open the player. You can view the full user guide at (http://students.cs.ucl.ac.uk/2020/group11/UseGuide.html)
